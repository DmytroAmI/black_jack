### The Objective of Blackjack

Beat The Dealer

How do you beat the dealer?

1. By drawing a hand value that is higher than the dealer’s hand value
2. By the dealer drawing a hand value that goes over 21.
3. By drawing a hand value of 21 on your first two cards, when the dealer does not.

How do you lose to the dealer? 

1. Your hand value exceeds 21.
2. The dealers hand has a greater value than yours at the end of the round

***
### How Do You Find a Hand’s Total Value?

Blackjack is played with a conventional deck of 52 playing cards and suits don’t matter.

1. 2 through 10 count at face value, i.e. a 2 counts as two, a 9 counts as nine.
2. Face cards (J,Q,K) count as 10.
3. Ace can count as a 1 or an 11 depending on which value helps the hand the most.

### Player decides how to play hand

- Stand – If your first two cards are acceptable, you can stand and the dealer will move on to the next player.
- Hit – If you would like more cards to improve your hand total, the dealer will deal you more cards, one at a time, until you either “bust” (go over 21) or you choose to stand. 
- Double Down – If you have a hand total that is advantageous to you but you need to take an additional card you can double your initial wager and the dealer will deal you only 1 additional card.
- Surrender – If you don’t like your initial hand, you have the option of giving it up in exchange for half your original bet back.

### Dealer plays

When the dealer has served every player, the dealers face-down card is turned up.
The dealer must continue to take cards until the total is 17 or more, at which point the dealer must stand.

***
### Payouts
Ok so you’re done playing your hand and the dealer is done playing their hand according to the restrictions above. One of 2 things will happen.

1. The dealer will bust, and they will pay even money (1 times the wager) to each hand that is still in play on the table. or…
2. The dealer will make a hand (17 through 21). If your hand is still in play, it’s a simple battle of who has the higher hand. If the dealer has the higher hand, they sweep your bet. If you have the higher hand, the dealer pays you one times your wager. If you and the dealer have the same hand-total, it’s considered a “push” and you keep your money but are not paid on your wager.

Now the round is over! That’s all there is to it. The cards get swept up and you start another round.
